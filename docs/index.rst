`SuperScreen <https://github.com/loganbvh/superscreen>`_ is an open-source Python package for simulating
the magnetic response of 2D superconductors and thin film superconducting devices of arbitrary geometry.
Using a matrix inversion method introduced by Brandt [Brandt-PRB-2005]_, ``SuperScreen`` solves
the coupled London and Maxwell's equations in and around superconducting thin films in the presence of
inhomogeneous applied magnetic fields and trapped flux.

.. tip::

   ``SuperScreen`` is described in detail in the following paper:

      SuperScreen: An open-source package for simulating the magnetic response of two-dimensional superconducting devices,
      Computer Physics Communications, Volume 280, 2022, 108464
      `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108464 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108464>`_.

   The accepted version of the paper can also be found on arXiv: `arXiv:2203.13388 <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.13388>`_.

``SuperScreen`` can be used to calculate:

- Self- and mutual-inductances in thin film superconducting structures
- Flux-focusing and Meissner screening effects in superconducting devices
- Vector magnetic fields resulting from currents in 2D superconducting structures
